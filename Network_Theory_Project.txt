Network_Theory_Project

Need to develop 2 programs:
- A client
- A server

The client reads a text file, then ecrypts it
into a cypher text file using an encryption alg. 
The client will then send it to the server.

The server will receive the cypher and save it.
The server will decrypt the the cypher text.

Encryption and decryption MUST be symmetric, and
developed by the student. They can't be very
simple.

I can create the text file.
-- filename: message.txt 

ASCII code of characters in plain text must be
in range 32 to 122.
This range contains:
-- all lowercase
-- all uppercase
-- numbers 0 - 9
-- space - /
-- : - @
-- [ - `

Need a one page report. 

------------------------------------------------
First lets create the message. Done.
That will be the trial text for the duration 
until we get a clean result.

------------------------------------------------
Lets develop the server and client programs.
Example code was provided so we'll use that as 
our basis. Lets try the server first.

I will have to get an understanding of socket
programming in java first. Done.

Lets begin with file
-- filename: Server.java

The server file is written and runs correctly.

Lets do the client next.
-- filename: Client.java

The client file is written and runs correctly.
There is clear communication between both programs.

--------------------------------------------------
Now we'll need to modify both programs to accept a 
text file.

Lets modify the client to accept and send a text file.
First we need to read a plain text file to terminal.
Done.

There is an exception error but we'll fix that later.
